Despite his lack of an officially recognized position and increasing social isolation, his work with McCulloch was influential, and was taken up by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img alt=\"Natural and artificial neurons\" width=\"500\" caption=\"Natural and artificial neurons\" src=\"images/chapter7_neuron.png\" id=\"neuron\"/>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Rosenblatt further developed the artificial neuron to give it the ability to learn.

They showed that a single layer of these devices was unable to learn some simple but critical mathematical functions (such as XOR). In the same book, they also showed that using multiple layers of the devices would allow these limitations to be addressed. Unfortunately, only the first of these insights was widely recognized. As a result, the global academic community nearly entirely gave up on neural networks for the next two decades.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Perhaps the most pivotal work in neural networks in the last 50 years was the multi-volume *Parallel Distributed Processing* (PDP) by David Rumelhart, James McClellan, and the PDP Research Group, released in 1986 by MIT Press. Chapter 1 lays out a similar hope to that shown by Rosenblatt:\n\n> : People are smarter than today's computers because the brain employs a basic computational architecture that is more suited to deal with a central aspect of the natural information processing tasks that people are so good at. ...We will introduce a computational framework for modeling cognitive processes that seems… closer than other frameworks to the style of computation as it might be done by the brain.\n\nThe premise that PDP is using here is that traditional computer programs work very differently to brains, and that might be why computer programs had been (at that point) so bad at doing things that brains find easy (such as recognizing objects in pictures). The authors claimed that the PDP approach was \"closer \nthan other frameworks\" to how the brain works, and therefore it might be better able to handle these kinds of tasks.\n\nIn fact, the approach laid out in PDP is very similar to the approach used in today's neural networks. The book defined parallel distributed processing as requiring:\n\n1. A set of *processing units*\n1. A *state of activation*\n1. An *output function* for each unit \n1. A *pattern of connectivity* among units \n1. A *propagation rule* for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities \n1. An *activation rule* for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit\n1. A *learning rule* whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience \n1. An *environment* within which the system must operate\n\nWe will see in this book that modern neural networks handle each of these requirements.\n\nIn the 1980's most models were built with a second layer of neurons, thus avoiding the problem that had been identified by Minsky and Papert (this was their \"pattern of connectivity among units,\" to use the framework above). And indeed, neural networks were widely used during the '80s and '90s for real, practical projects. However, again a misunderstanding of the theoretical issues held back the field. In theory, adding just one extra layer of neurons was enough to allow any mathematical function to be approximated with these neural networks, but in practice such networks were often too big and too slow to be useful.\n\nAlthough researchers showed 30 years ago that to get practical good performance you need to use even more layers of neurons, it is only in the last decade that this principle has been more widely appreciated and applied. Neural networks are now finally living up to their potential, thanks to the use of more layers, coupled with the capacity to do so due to improvements in computer hardware, increases in data availability, and algorithmic tweaks that allow neural networks to be trained faster and more easily. We now have what Rosenblatt promised: \"a machine capable of perceiving, recognizing, and identifying its surroundings without any human training or control.\"\n\nThis is what you will learn how to build in this book.

The basic idea is to teach the *whole game*. That means that if you're teaching baseball, you first take people to a baseball game or get them to play it. You don't teach them how to wind twine to make a baseball from scratch, the physics of a parabola, or the coefficient of friction of a ball on a bat.\n\nPaul Lockhart, a Columbia math PhD, former Brown professor, and K-12 math teacher, imagines in the influential [essay](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) \"A Mathematician's Lament\" a nightmare world where music and art are taught the way math is taught. Children are not allowed to listen to or play music until they have spent over a decade mastering music notation and theory, spending classes transposing sheet music into a different key. In art class, students study colors and applicators, but aren't allowed to actually paint until college. Sound absurd? This is how math is taught–-we require students to spend years doing rote memorization and learning dry, disconnected *fundamentals* that we claim will pay off later, long after most of them quit the subject.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where many teaching resources on deep learning begin–-asking learners to follow along with the definition of the Hessian and theorems for the Taylor approximation of your loss functions, without ever giving examples of actual working code. We're not knocking calculus. We love calculus, and Sylvain has even taught it at the college level, but we don't think it's the best place to start when learning deep learning!\n\nIn deep learning, it really helps if you have the motivation to fix your model to get it to do better. That's when you start learning the relevant theory. But you need to have the model in the first place. We teach almost everything through real examples. As we build out those examples, we go deeper and deeper, and we'll show you how to make your projects better and better. This means that you'll be gradually learning all the theoretical foundations you need, in context, in such a way that you'll see why it matters and how it works.\n\nSo, here's our commitment to you. Throughout this book, we will follow these principles:\n\n- Teaching the *whole game*. We'll start by showing how to use a complete, working, very usable, state-of-the-art deep learning network to solve real-world problems, using simple, expressive tools. And then we'll gradually dig deeper and deeper into understanding how those tools are made, and how the tools that make those tools are made, and so on…\n- Always teaching through examples. We'll ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation.\n- Simplifying as much as possible. We've spent years building tools and teaching methods that make previously complex topics very simple.\n- Removing barriers. Deep learning has, until now, been a very exclusive game. We're breaking it open, and ensuring that everyone can play.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The hardest part of deep learning is artisanal: how do you know if you've got enough data, whether it is in the right format, if your model is training properly, and, if it's not, what you should do about it? That is why we believe in learning by doing. As with basic data science skills, with deep learning you only get better through practical experience. Trying to spend too much time on the theory can be counterproductive. The key is to just code and try to solve problems: the theory can come later, when you have context and motivation.\n\nThere will be times when the journey will feel hard. Times where you feel stuck. Don't give up! Rewind through the book to find the last bit where you definitely weren't stuck, and then read slowly through from there to find the first thing that isn't clear. Then try some code experiments yourself, and Google around for more tutorials on whatever the issue you're stuck with is—often you'll find some different angle on the material might help it to click. Also, it's expected and normal to not understand everything (especially the code) on first reading. Trying to understand the material serially before proceeding can sometimes be hard. Sometimes things click into place after you get more context from parts down the road, from having a bigger picture. So if you do get stuck on a section, try moving on anyway and make a note to come back to it later.\n\nRemember, you don't need any particular academic background to succeed at deep learning.

After PyTorch came out in 2017 we spent over a thousand hours testing it before deciding that we would use it for future courses, software development, and research. Since that time PyTorch has become the world's fastest-growing deep learning library and is already used for most research papers at top conferences. This is generally a leading indicator of usage in industry, because these are the papers that end up getting used in products and services commercially. We have found that PyTorch is the most flexible and expressive library for deep learning. It does not trade off speed for simplicity, but provides both.\n\nPyTorch works best as a low-level foundation library, providing the basic operations for higher-level functionality. The fastai library is the most popular library for adding this higher-level functionality on top of PyTorch. It's also particularly well suited to the purposes of this book, because it is unique in providing a deeply layered software architecture (there's even a [peer-reviewed academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04688) about this layered API). In this book, as we go deeper and deeper into the foundations of deep learning, we will also go deeper and deeper into the layers of fastai.

Where we are teaching high-level concepts, we will use high-level fastai code. Where we are teaching low-level concepts, we will use low-level PyTorch, or even pure Python code.\n\nIf it feels like new deep learning libraries are appearing at a rapid pace nowadays, then you need to be prepared for a much faster rate of change in the coming months and years. As more people enter the field, they will bring more skills and ideas, and try more things. You should assume that whatever specific libraries and software you learn today will be obsolete in a year or two. Just think about the number of changes in libraries and technology stacks that occur all the time in the world of web programming—a much more mature and slow-growing area than deep learning.

Also try to recall what the code is demonstrating.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To open a notebook, just click on it.

There are two main types of cell:\n\n- Cells containing formatted text, images, and so forth. These use a format called *markdown*, which you will learn about soon.\n- Cells containing code that can be executed, and outputs will appear immediately underneath (which could be plain text, tables, images, animations, sounds, or even interactive applications).\n\nJupyter notebooks can be in one of two modes: edit mode or command mode. In edit mode typing on your keyboard enters the letters into the cell in the usual way. However, in command mode, you will not see any flashing cursor, and the keys on your keyboard will each have a special function.\n\nBefore continuing, press the Escape key on your keyboard to switch to command mode (if you are already in command mode, this does nothing, so press it now just in case). To see a complete list of all of the functions available, press H; press Escape to remove this help screen. Notice that in command mode, unlike most programs, commands do not require you to hold down Control, Alt, or similar—you simply press the required letter key.\n\nYou can make a copy of a cell by pressing C (the cell needs to be selected first, indicated with an outline around it; if it is not already selected, click on it once). Then press V to paste a copy of it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Click on the cell that begins with the line \"# CLICK ME\" to select it. The first character in that line indicates that what follows is a comment in Python, so it is ignored when executing the cell. The rest of the cell is, believe it or not, a complete system for creating and training a state-of-the-art model for recognizing cats versus dogs. So, let's train it now! To do so, just press Shift-Enter on your keyboard, or press the Play button on the toolbar. Then wait a few minutes while the following things happen:\n\n1. A dataset called the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) that contains 7,349 images of cats and dogs from 37 different breeds will be downloaded from the fast.ai datasets collection to the GPU server you are using, and will then be extracted.\n2. A *pretrained model* that has already been trained on 1.3 million images, using a competition-winning model will be downloaded from the internet.\n3. The pretrained model will be *fine-tuned* using the latest advances in transfer learning, to create a model that is specially customized for recognizing dogs and cats.\n\nThe first two steps only need to be run once on your GPU server. If you run the cell again, it will use the dataset and model that have already been downloaded, rather than downloading them again.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What Is Machine Learning?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Your classifier is a deep learning model. As was already mentioned, deep learning models use neural networks, which originally date from the 1950s and have become powerful very recently thanks to recent advancements.\n\nAnother key piece of context is that deep learning is just a modern area in the more general discipline of *machine learning*. To understand the essence of what you did when you trained your own classification model, you don't need to understand deep learning. It is enough to see how your model and your training process are examples of the concepts that apply to machine learning in general.\n\nSo in this section, we will describe what machine learning is. We will look at the key concepts, and show how they can be traced back to the original essay that introduced them.\n\n*Machine learning* is, like regular programming, a way to get computers to complete a specific task. But how would we use regular programming to do what we just did in the last section: recognize dogs versus cats in photos? We would have to write down for the computer the exact steps necessary to complete the task.\n\nNormally, it's easy enough for us to write down the steps to complete a task when we're writing a program. We just think about the steps we'd take if we had to do the task by hand, and then we translate them into code. For instance, we can write a function that sorts a list.

We really don't know, since it all happens in our brain without us being consciously aware of it!\n\nRight back at the dawn of computing, in 1949, an IBM researcher named Arthur Samuel started working on a different way to get computers to complete tasks, which he called *machine learning*. In his classic 1962 essay \"Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation\", he wrote:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> : Programming a computer for such computations is, at best, a difficult task, not primarily because of any inherent complexity in the computer itself but, rather, because of the need to spell out every minute step of the process in the most exasperating detail.

First, we need to understand what Samuel means by a *weight assignment*.\n\nWeights are just variables, and a weight assignment is a particular choice of values for those variables. The program's inputs are values that it processes in order to produce its results—for instance, taking image pixels as inputs, and returning the classification \"dog\" as a result. The program's weight assignments are other values that define how the program will operate.\n\nSince they will affect the program they are in a sense another kind of input, so we will update our basic picture in <<basic_program>> and replace it with <<weight_assignment>> in order to take this into account.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#hide_input\n#caption A program using weight assignment\n#id weight_assignment\ngv('''model[shape=box3d width=1 height=0.7]\ninputs->model->results; weights->model''')","metadata":{"hide_input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-26T05:08:50.258275Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-26T05:08:50.258704Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-26T05:08:50.284639Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-26T05:08:50.258672Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-26T05:08:50.283129Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"execution_count":16,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"image/svg+xml":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN\"\n \"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd\">\n<!-- Generated by graphviz version 8.1.0 (20230707.2238)\n -->\n<!-- Title: G Pages: 1 -->\n<svg width=\"345pt\" height=\"98pt\"\n viewBox=\"0.00 0.00 345.26 98.00\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n<g id=\"graph0\" class=\"graph\" transform=\"scale(1 1) rotate(0) translate(4 94)\">\n<title>G</title>\n<polygon fill=\"white\" stroke=\"none\" points=\"-4,4 -4,-94 341.26,-94 341.26,4 -4,4\"/>\n<!-- model -->\n<g id=\"node1\" class=\"node\">\n<title>model</title>\n<polygon fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"209.36,-70.2 141.36,-70.2 137.36,-66.2 137.36,-19.8 205.36,-19.8 209.36,-23.8 209.36,-70.2\"/>\n<polyline fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"205.36,-66.2 137.36,-66.2\"/>\n<polyline fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"205.36,-66.2 205.36,-19.8\"/>\n<polyline fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"205.36,-66.2 209.36,-70.2\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"173.36\" y=\"-40.33\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">model</text>\n</g>\n<!-- results -->\n<g id=\"node3\" class=\"node\">\n<title>results</title>\n<ellipse fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" cx=\"291.31\" cy=\"-45\" rx=\"45.95\" ry=\"18\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"291.31\" y=\"-40.33\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">results</text>\n</g>\n<!-- model&#45;&gt;results -->\n<g id=\"edge2\" class=\"edge\">\n<title>model&#45;&gt;results</title>\n<path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" d=\"M209.78,-45C217.56,-45 225.98,-45 234.35,-45\"/>\n<polygon fill=\"black\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"234.25,-48.5 244.25,-45 234.25,-41.5 234.25,-48.5\"/>\n</g>\n<!-- inputs -->\n<g id=\"node2\" class=\"node\">\n<title>inputs</title>\n<ellipse fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" cx=\"50.68\" cy=\"-72\" rx=\"42.79\" ry=\"18\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"50.68\" y=\"-67.33\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">inputs</text>\n</g>\n<!-- inputs&#45;&gt;model -->\n<g id=\"edge1\" class=\"edge\">\n<title>inputs&#45;&gt;model</title>\n<path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" d=\"M89.2,-63.61C100.98,-60.97 114.11,-58.03 126.4,-55.28\"/>\n<polygon fill=\"black\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"126.93,-58.53 135.92,-52.93 125.4,-51.7 126.93,-58.53\"/>\n</g>\n<!-- weights -->\n<g id=\"node4\" class=\"node\">\n<title>weights</title>\n<ellipse fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" cx=\"50.68\" cy=\"-18\" rx=\"50.68\" ry=\"18\"/>\n<text text-anchor=\"middle\" x=\"50.68\" y=\"-13.32\" font-family=\"Times,serif\" font-size=\"14.00\">weights</text>\n</g>\n<!-- weights&#45;&gt;model -->\n<g id=\"edge3\" class=\"edge\">\n<title>weights&#45;&gt;model</title>\n<path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"black\" d=\"M94.23,-27.52C104.61,-29.84 115.75,-32.33 126.28,-34.69\"/>\n<polygon fill=\"black\" stroke=\"black\" points=\"125.45,-38.32 135.98,-37.08 126.98,-31.48 125.45,-38.32\"/>\n</g>\n</g>\n</svg>\n","text/plain":"<graphviz.sources.Source at 0x7c1e2fe619c0>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We've changed the name of our box from *program* to *model*. This is to follow modern terminology and to reflect that the *model* is a special kind of program: it's one that can do *many different things*, depending on the *weights*. It can be implemented in many different ways. For instance, in Samuel's checkers program, different values of the weights would result in different checkers-playing strategies. \n\n(By the way, what Samuel called \"weights\" are most generally referred to as model *parameters* these days, in case you have encountered that term. The term *weights* is reserved for a particular type of model parameter.)\n\nNext, Samuel said we need an *automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance*. In the case of his checkers program, the \"actual performance\" of a model would be how well it plays. And you could automatically test the performance of two models by setting them to play against each other, and seeing which one usually wins.\n\nFinally, he says we need *a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance*. For instance, we could look at the difference in weights between the winning model and the losing model, and adjust the weights a little further in the winning direction.\n\nWe can now see why he said that such a procedure *could be made entirely automatic and... a machine so programmed would \"learn\" from its experience*. Learning would become entirely automatic when the adjustment of the weights was also automatic—when instead of us improving a model by adjusting its weights manually, we relied on an automated

There might be a range of checkers strategies encoded, and some kind of search mechanism, and then the weights could vary how strategies are selected, what parts of the board are focused on during a search, and so forth. But it's not at all obvious what the model might look like for an image recognition program, or for understanding text, or for many other interesting problems we might imagine.\n\nWhat we would like is some kind of function that is so flexible that it could be used to solve any given problem, just by varying its weights. Amazingly enough, this function actually exists! It's the neural network, which we already discussed. That is, if you regard a neural network as a mathematical function, it turns out to be a function which is extremely flexible depending on its weights. **A mathematical proof called the *universal approximation theorem* shows that this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory.** The fact that neural networks are so flexible means that, in practice, they are often a suitable kind of model, and you can focus your effort on the process of training them—that is, of finding good weight assignments.\n\nBut what about that process?  One could imagine that you might need to find a new \"mechanism\" for automatically updating weights for every problem. This would be laborious. W**hat we'd like here as well is a completely general way to update the weights of a neural network, to make it improve at any given task.** Conveniently, this also exists!\n\n**This is called *stochastic gradient descent* (SGD)**. We'll see how neural networks and SGD work in detail in <<chapter_mnist_basics>>, as well as explaining the universal approximation theorem.

Our results are the values that are calculated by the neural net, like \"dog\" or \"cat.\"\n\nWhat about the next piece, an *automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance*? Determining \"actual performance\" is easy enough: we can simply define our model's performance as its accuracy at predicting the correct answers.\n\nPutting this all together, and assuming that SGD is our mechanism for updating the weight assignments, we can see how our image classifier is a machine learning model, much like Samuel envisioned.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A Bit of Deep Learning Jargon","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Samuel was working in the 1960s, and since then terminology has changed.

learning model:\n\n- A model cannot be created without data.\n- A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\n- This learning approach only creates *predictions*, not recommended *actions*.\n- It's not enough to just have examples of input data; we need *labels* for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren't enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats).\n\nGenerally speaking, we've seen that most organizations that say they don't have enough data, actually mean they don't have enough *labeled* data. If any organization is interested in doing something in practice with a model, then presumably they have some inputs they plan to run their model against. And presumably they've been doing that some other way for a while (e.g., manually, or with some heuristic program), so they have data from those processes! For instance, a radiology practice will almost certainly have an archive of medical scans (since they need to be able to check how their patients are progressing over time), but those scans may not have structured labels containing a list of diagnoses or interventions (since radiologists generally create free-text natural language reports, not structured data). We'll be discussing labeling approaches a lot in this book, because it's such an important issue in practice.\n\nSince these kinds of machine learning models can only make *predictions* (i.e., attempt to replicate labels), this can result in a significant gap between organizational goals and model capabilities. For instance, in this book you'll learn how to create a *recommendation system* that can predict what products a user might purchase. This is often used in e-commerce, such as to customize products shown on a home page by showing the highest-ranked items. But such a model is generally created by looking at a user and their buying history (*inputs*) and what they went on to buy or look at (*labels*), which means that the model is likely to tell you about products the user already has or already knows about, rather than new products that they are most likely to be interested in hearing about. That's very different to what, say, an expert at your local bookseller might do, where they ask questions to figure out your taste, and then tell you about authors or series that you've never heard of before.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another critical insight comes from considering how a model interacts with its environment. This can create *feedback loops*, as described here:\n\n- A *predictive policing* model is created based on where arrests have been made in the past. In practice, this is not actually predicting crime, but rather predicting arrests, and is therefore partially simply reflecting biases in existing policing processes.\n- Law enforcement officers then might use that model to decide where to focus their police activity, resulting in increased arrests in those areas.\n- Data on these additional arrests would then be fed back in to retrain future versions of the model.\n\nThis is a *positive feedback loop*, where the more the model is used, the more biased the data becomes, making the model even more biased, and so forth.\n\nFeedback loops can also create problems in commercial settings. For instance, a video recommendation system might be biased toward recommending content consumed by the biggest watchers of video (e.g., conspiracy theorists and extremists tend to watch more online video content than the average), resulting in those users increasing their video consumption, resulting in more of those kinds of videos being recommended. We'll consider this topic more in detail in <<chapter_ethics>>.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that you have seen the base of the theory, let's go back to our code example and see in detail how the code corresponds to the process we just described.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How Our Image Recognizer Works","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see just how our image recognizer code maps to these ideas.

The fastai library and fast.ai notebooks are full of great little tips that have helped make me a better programmer. For instance, notice that the fastai library doesn't just return a string containing the path to the dataset, but a `Path` object. This is a really useful class from the Python 3 standard library that makes accessing files and directories much easier. If you haven't come across it before, be sure to check out its documentation or a tutorial and try it out. Note that the https://book.fast.ai[website] contains links to recommended tutorials for each chapter. I'll keep letting you know about little coding tips I've found useful as we come across them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the third line we define a function, `is_cat`, which labels cats based on a filename rule provided by the dataset creators:\n```python\ndef is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper()\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We use that function in the fourth line, which tells fastai what kind of dataset we have and how it is structured:\n\n```python\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func(\n    path, get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,\n    label_func=is_cat, item_tfms=Resize(224))\n```\n\nThere are various different classes for different kinds of deep learning datasets and problems—here we're using `ImageDataLoaders`. The first part of the class name will generally be the type of data you have, such as image, or text.\n\nThe other important piece of information that we have to tell fastai is how to get the labels from the dataset. Computer vision datasets are normally structured in such a way that the label for an image is part of the filename, or path—most commonly the parent folder name. fastai comes with a number of standardized labeling methods, and ways to write your own. Here we're telling fastai to use the `is_cat` function we just defined.\n\nFinally, we define the `Transform`s that we need. A `Transform` contains code that is applied automatically during training; fastai includes many predefined `Transform`s, and adding new ones is as simple as creating a Python function. There are two kinds: `item_tfms` are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel square), while `batch_tfms` are applied to a *batch* of items at a time using the GPU, so they're particularly fast (we'll see many examples of these throughout this book).\n\nWhy 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything. If you increase the size, you'll often get a model with better results (since it will be able to focus on more details), but at the price of speed and memory consumption; the opposite is true if you decrease the size. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Note: Classification and Regression: _classification_ and _regression_ have very specific meanings in machine learning. These are the two main types of model that we will be investigating in this book. A classification model is one which attempts to predict a class, or category. That is, it's predicting from a number of discrete possibilities, such as \"dog\" or \"cat.\" A regression model is one which attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as a temperature or a location. Sometimes people use the word _regression_ to refer to a particular kind of model called a _linear regression model_; this is a bad practice, and we won't be using that terminology in this book!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Pet dataset contains 7,390 pictures of dogs and cats, consisting of 37 different breeds. Each image is labeled using its filename: for instance the file *great\\_pyrenees\\_173.jpg* is the 173rd example of an image of a Great Pyrenees breed dog in the dataset. The filenames start with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter otherwise. We have to tell fastai how to get labels from the filenames, which we do by calling `from_name_func` (which means that labels can be extracted using a function applied to the filename), and passing `is_cat`, which returns `x[0].isupper()`, which evaluates to `True` if the first letter is uppercase (i.e., it's a cat).\n\nThe most important parameter to mention here is `valid_pct=0.2`. This tells fastai to hold out 20% of the data and *not use it for training the model at all*. This 20% of the data is called the *validation set*; the remaining 80% is called the *training set*. The validation set is used to measure the accuracy of the model. By default, the 20% that is held out is selected randomly. The parameter `seed=42` sets the *random seed* to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it—this way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\n\nfastai will *always* show you your model's accuracy using *only* the validation set, *never* the training set. This is absolutely critical, because if you train a large enough model for a long enough time, it will eventually memorize the label of every item in your dataset! The result will not actually be a useful model, because what we care about is how well our model works on *previously unseen images*. That is always our goal when creating a model: for it to be useful on data that the model only sees in the future, after it has been trained.\n\nEven when your model has not fully memorized all your data, earlier on in training it may have memorized certain parts of it. As a result, the longer you train for, the better your accuracy will get on the training set; the validation set accuracy will also improve for a while, but eventually it will start getting worse as the model starts to memorize the training set, rather than finding generalizable underlying patterns in the data. When this happens, we say that the model is *overfitting*.\n\n<<img_overfit>> shows what happens when you overfit, using a simplified example where we have just one parameter, and some randomly generated data based on the function `x**2`. As you can see, although the predictions in the overfit model are accurate for data near the observed data points, they are way off when outside of that range.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"images/att_00000.png\" alt=\"Example of overfitting\" caption=\"Example of overfitting\" id=\"img_overfit\" width=\"700\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Overfitting is the single most important and challenging issue** when training for all machine learning practitioners, and all algorithms. As you will see, it is very easy to create a model that does a great job at making predictions on the exact data it has been trained on, but it is much harder to make accurate predictions on data the model has never seen before. And of course, this is the data that will actually matter in practice. For instance, if you create a handwritten digit classifier (as we will very soon!) and use it to recognize numbers written on checks, then you are never going to see any of the numbers that the model was trained on—checks will have slightly different variations of writing to deal with. You will learn many methods to avoid overfitting in this book. However, you should only use those methods after you have confirmed that overfitting is actually occurring (i.e., you have actually observed the validation accuracy getting worse during training). We often see practitioners using over-fitting avoidance techniques even when they have enough data that they didn't need to do so, ending up with a model that may be less accurate than what they could have achieved.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> important: Validation Set: When you train a model, you must _always_ have both a training set and a validation set, and must measure the accuracy of your model only on the validation set.

It's the current state-of-the-art approach to creating computer vision models. We'll be learning all about how CNNs work in this book. Their structure is inspired by how the human vision system works.\n\nThere are many different architectures in fastai, which we will introduce in this book (as well as discussing how to create your own). Most of the time, however, picking an architecture isn't a very important part of the deep learning process. It's something that academics love to talk about, but in practice it is unlikely to be something you need to spend much time on. There are some standard architectures that work most of the time, and in this case we're using one called _ResNet_ that we'll be talking a lot about during the book; it is both fast and accurate for many datasets and problems. The `34` in `resnet34` refers to the number of layers in this variant of the architecture (other options are `18`, `50`, `101`, and `152`). Models using architectures with more layers take longer to train, and are more prone to overfitting (i.e. you can't train them for as many epochs before the accuracy on the validation set starts getting worse). On the other hand, when using more data, they can be quite a bit more accurate.\n\nWhat is a metric? A *metric* is a function that measures the quality of the model's predictions using the validation set, and will be printed at the end of each *epoch*. In this case, we're using `error_rate`, which is a function provided by fastai that does just what it says: tells you what percentage of images in the validation set are being classified incorrectly. Another common metric for classification is `accuracy` (which is just `1.0 - error_rate`). fastai provides many more, which will be discussed throughout this book.\n\nThe concept of a metric may remind you of *loss*, but there is an important distinction. The entire purpose of loss is to define a \"measure of performance\" that the training system can use to update weights automatically. In other words, a good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do. At times, you might decide that the loss function is a suitable metric, but that is not necessarily the case.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`vision_learner` also has a parameter `pretrained`, which defaults to `True` (so it's used in this case, even though we haven't specified it), which sets the weights in your model to values that have already been trained by experts to recognize a thousand different categories across 1.3 million photos (using the famous [*ImageNet* dataset](http://www.image-net.org/)). A model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a *pretrained model*. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you've even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. And, as you'll see, in a deep learning model many of these capabilities are things you'll need, almost regardless of the details of your project. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks.\n\nWhen using a pretrained model, `vision_learner` will remove the last layer, since that is always specifically customized to the original training task (i.e. ImageNet dataset classification), and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights, of an appropriate size for the dataset you are working with. This last part of the model is known as the *head*.\n\nUsing pretrained models is the *most* important method we have to allow us to train more accurate models, more quickly, with less data, and less time and money. You might think that would mean that using pretrained models would be the most studied area in academic deep learning... but you'd be very, very wrong! The importance of pretrained models is generally not recognized or discussed in most courses, books, or software library features, and is rarely considered in academic papers. As we write this at the start of 2020, things are just starting to change, but it's likely to take a while. So be careful: most people you speak to will probably greatly underestimate what you can do in deep learning with few resources, because they probably won't deeply understand how to use pretrained models.\n\nUsing a pretrained model for a task different to what it was originally trained for is known as *transfer learning*. Unfortunately, because transfer learning is so under-studied, few domains have pretrained models available. For instance, there are currently few pretrained models available in medicine, making transfer learning challenging to use in that domain. In addition, it is not yet well understood how to use transfer learning for tasks such as time series analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> jargon: Transfer learning: Using a pretrained model for a task different to what it was originally trained for.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The sixth line of our code tells fastai how to *fit* the model:\n\n```python\nlearn.fine_tune(1)\n```\n\nAs we've discussed, the architecture only describes a *template* for a mathematical function; it doesn't actually do anything until we provide values for the millions of parameters it contains.\n\nThis is the key to deep learning—determining how to fit the parameters of a model to get it to solve your problem. In order to fit a model, we have to provide at least one piece of information: how many times to look at each image (known as number of *epochs*). The number of epochs you select will largely depend on how much time you have available, and how long you find it takes in practice to fit your model. If you select a number that is too small, you can always train for more epochs later.\n\nBut why is the method called `fine_tune`, and not `fit`? fastai actually *does* have a method called `fit`, which does indeed fit a model (i.e. look at images in the training set multiple times, each time updating the parameters to make the predictions closer and closer to the target labels). But in this case, we've started with a pretrained model, and we don't want to throw away all those capabilities that it already has.

Use the number of epochs requested when calling the method to fit the entire model, updating the weights of the later layers (especially the head) faster than the earlier layers (which, as we'll see, generally don't require many changes from the pretrained weights).\n\nThe *head* of a model is the part that is newly added to be specific to the new dataset. An *epoch* is one complete pass through the dataset.

There is a vast body of research showing how to deeply inspect deep learning models, and get rich insights from them. Having said that, all kinds of machine learning models (including deep learning, and traditional statistical models) can be challenging to fully understand, especially when considering how they will behave when coming across data that is very different to the data used to train them. We'll be discussing this issue throughout this book.\n\nIn 2013 a PhD student, Matt Zeiler, and his supervisor, Rob Fergus, published the paper [\"Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf), which showed how to visualize the neural network weights learned in each layer of a model.

(Note that for each layer only a subset of the features are shown; in practice there are thousands across all of the layers.) These are the basic building blocks that the model has learned for computer vision. They have been widely analyzed by neuroscientists and computer vision researchers, and it turns out that these learned building blocks are very similar to the basic visual machinery in the human eye, as well as the handcrafted computer vision features that were developed prior to the days of deep learning.

Take a moment to review those definitions and read the following summary. If you can follow the explanation, then you're well equipped to understand the discussions to come.\n\n*Machine learning* is a discipline where we define a program not by writing it entirely ourselves, but by learning from data. *Deep learning* is a specialty within machine learning that uses *neural networks* with multiple *layers*. *Image classification* is a representative example (also known as *image recognition*). We start with *labeled data*; that is, a set of images where we have assigned a *label* to each image indicating what it represents. Our goal is to produce a program, called a *model*, which, given a new image, will make an accurate *prediction* regarding what that new image represents.\n\nEvery model starts with a choice of *architecture*, a general template for how that kind of model works internally. The process of *training* (or *fitting*) the model is the process of finding a set of *parameter values* (or *weights*) that specialize that general architecture into a model that works well for our particular kind of data. In order to define how well a model does on a single prediction, we need to define a *loss function*, which determines how we score a prediction as good or bad.\n\nTo make the training process go faster, we might start with a *pretrained model*—a model that has already been trained on someone else's data. We can then adapt it to our data by training it a bit more on our data, a process called *fine-tuning*.\n\nWhen we train a model, a key concern is to ensure that our model *generalizes*—that is, that it learns general lessons from our data which also apply to new items it will encounter, so that it can make good predictions on those items. The risk is that if we train our model badly, instead of learning general lessons it effectively memorizes what it has already seen, and then it will make poor predictions about new images. Such a failure is called *overfitting*. In order to avoid this, we always divide our data into two parts, the *training set* and the *validation set*. We train the model by showing it only the training set and then we evaluate how well the model is doing by seeing how well it performs on items from the validation set. In this way, we check if the lessons the model learns from the training set are lessons that generalize to the validation set. In order for a person to assess how well the model is doing on the validation set overall, we define a *metric*. During the training process, when the model has seen every item in the training set, we call that an *epoch*.\n\nAll these concepts apply to machine learning in general. That is, they apply to all sorts of schemes for defining a model by training it with data. What makes deep learning distinctive is a particular class of architectures: the architectures based on *neural networks*. In particular, tasks like image classification rely heavily on *convolutional neural networks*, which we will discuss shortly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Deep Learning Is Not Just for Image Classification","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Deep learning's effectiveness for classifying images has been widely discussed in recent years, even showing _superhuman_ results on complex tasks like recognizing malignant tumors in CT scans.

In machine learning and deep learning, we can’t do anything without data. So, the people that create datasets for us to train our models on are the (often underappreciated) heroes. Some of the most useful and important datasets are those that become important *academic baselines*; that is, datasets that are widely studied by researchers and used to compare algorithmic changes. Some of these become household names (at least, among households that train models!), such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.\n\nThe datasets used in this book have been selected because they provide great examples of the kinds of data that you are likely to encounter, and the academic literature has many examples of model results using these datasets to which you can compare your work.\n\nMost datasets used in this book took the creators a lot of work to build. For instance, later in the book we’ll be showing you how to create a model that can translate between French and English. The key input to this is a French/English parallel text corpus prepared back in 2009 by Professor Chris Callison-Burch of the University of Pennsylvania. This dataset contains over 20 million sentence pairs in French and English. He built the dataset in a really clever way: by crawling millions of Canadian web pages (which are often multilingual) and then using a set of simple heuristics to transform URLs of French content onto URLs pointing to the same content in English.\n\nAs you look at datasets throughout this book, think about where they might have come from, and how they might have been curated. Then think about what kinds of interesting datasets you could create for your own projects. (We’ll even take you step by step through the process of creating your own image dataset soon.)\n\nfast.ai has spent a lot of time creating cut-down versions of popular datasets that are specially designed to support rapid prototyping and experimentation, and to be easier to learn with. In this book we will often start by using one of the cut-down versions and later scale up to the full-size version (just as we're doing in this chapter!). In fact, this is how the world’s top practitioners do their modeling in practice; they do most of their experimentation and prototyping with subsets of their data, and only use the full dataset when they have a good understanding of what they have to do.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### End sidebar","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Each of the models we trained showed a training and validation loss. A good validation set is one of the most important pieces of the training process. Let's see why and learn how to create one.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Validation Sets and Test Sets","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we've discussed, the goal of a model is to make predictions about data. But the model training process is fundamentally dumb. If we trained a model with all our data, and then evaluated the model using that same data, we would not be able to tell how well our model can perform on data it hasn’t seen. Without this very valuable piece of information to guide us in training our model, there is a very good chance it would become good at making predictions about that data but would perform poorly on new data.\n\nTo avoid this, our first step was to split our dataset into two sets: the *training set* (which our model sees in training) and the *validation set*, also known as the *development set* (which is used only for evaluation). This lets us test that the model learns lessons from the training data that generalize to new data, the validation data.\n\nOne way to understand this situation is that, in a sense, we don't want our model to get good results by \"cheating.\" If it makes an accurate prediction for a data item, that should be because it has learned characteristics of that kind of item, and not because the model has been shaped by *actually having seen that particular item*.\n\nSplitting off our validation data means our model never sees it in training and so is completely untainted by it, and is not cheating in any way. Right?\n\nIn fact, not necessarily. The situation is more subtle. This is because in realistic scenarios we rarely build a model just by training its weight parameters once. Instead, we are likely to explore many versions of a model through various modeling choices regarding network architecture, learning rates, data augmentation strategies, and other factors we will discuss in upcoming chapters. Many of these choices can be described as choices of *hyperparameters*. The word reflects that they are parameters about parameters, since they are the higher-level choices that govern the meaning of the weight parameters.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The problem is that even though the ordinary training process is only looking at predictions on the training data when it learns values for the weight parameters, the same is not true of us. We, as modelers, are evaluating the model by looking at predictions on the validation data when we decide to explore new hyperparameter values! So subsequent versions of the model are, indirectly, shaped by us having seen the validation data. Just as the automatic training process is in danger of overfitting the training data, we are in danger of overfitting the validation data through human trial and error and exploration.\n\nThe solution to this conundrum is to introduce another level of even more highly reserved data, the *test set*. Just as we hold back the validation data from the training process, we must hold back the test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model; it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end of our efforts. In effect, we define a hierarchy of cuts of our data, based on how fully we want to hide it from training and modeling processes: training data is fully exposed, the validation data is less exposed, and test data is totally hidden. This hierarchy parallels the different kinds of modeling and evaluation processes themselves—the automatic training process with back propagation, the more manual process of trying different hyper-parameters between training sessions, and the assessment of our final result.\n\nThe test and validation sets should have enough data to ensure that you get a good estimate of your accuracy. If you're creating a cat detector, for instance, you generally want at least 30 cats in your validation set. That means that if you have a dataset with thousands of items, using the default 20% validation set size may be more than you need. On the other hand, if you have lots of data, using some of it for validation probably doesn't have any downsides.\n\nHaving two levels of \"reserved data\"—a validation set and a test set, with one level representing data that you are virtually hiding from yourself—may seem a bit extreme. But the reason it is often necessary is because models tend to gravitate toward the simplest way to do good predictions (memorization), and we as fallible humans tend to gravitate toward fooling ourselves about how well our models are performing. The discipline of the test set helps us keep ourselves intellectually honest. That doesn't mean we *always* need a separate test set—if you have very little data, you may need to just have a validation set—but generally it's best to use one if at all possible.\n\nThis same discipline can be critical if you intend to hire a third party to perform modeling work on your behalf. A third party might not understand your requirements accurately, or their incentives might even encourage them to misunderstand them. A good test set can greatly mitigate these risks and let you evaluate whether their work solves your actual problem.\n\nTo put it bluntly, if you're a senior decision maker in your organization (or you're advising senior decision makers), the most important takeaway is this: if you ensure that you really understand what test and validation sets are and why they're important, then you'll avoid the single biggest source of failures we've seen when organizations decide to use AI. For instance, if you're considering bringing in an external vendor or service, make sure that you hold out some test data that the vendor *never gets to see*. Then *you* check their model on your test data, using a metric that *you* choose based on what actually matters to you in practice, and *you* decide what level of performance is adequate. (It's also a good idea for you to try out some simple baseline yourself, so you know what a really simple model can achieve. Often it'll turn out that your simple model performs just as well as one produced by an external \"expert\"!)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Use Judgment in Defining Test Sets","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To do a good job of defining a validation set (and possibly a test set), you will sometimes want to do more than just randomly grab a fraction of your original dataset. Remember: a key property of the validation and test sets is that they must be representative of the new data you will see in the future. This may sound like an impossible order! By definition, you haven’t seen this data yet. But you usually still do know some things.\n\nIt's instructive to look at a few example cases. Many of these examples come from predictive modeling competitions on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) platform, which is a good representation of problems and methods you might see in practice.\n\nOne case might be if you are looking at time series data. For a time series, choosing a random subset of the data will be both too easy (you can look at the data both before and after the dates you are trying to predict) and not representative of most business use cases (where you are using historical data to build a model for use in the future). If your data includes the date and you are building a model to use in the future, you will want to choose a continuous section with the latest dates as your validation set (for instance, the last two weeks or last month of available data).\n\nSuppose you want to split the time series data in <<timeseries1>> into training and validation sets.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"images/timeseries1.png\" width=\"400\" id=\"timeseries1\" caption=\"A time series\" alt=\"A serie of values\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A random subset is a poor choice (too easy to fill in the gaps, and not indicative of what you'll need in production), as we can see in <<timeseries2>>.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"images/timeseries2.png\" width=\"400\" id=\"timeseries2\" caption=\"A poor training subset\" alt=\"Random training subset\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Instead, use the earlier data as your training set (and the later data for the validation set), as shown in <<timeseries3>>.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"images/timeseries3.png\" width=\"400\" id=\"timeseries3\" caption=\"A good training subset\" alt=\"Training subset using the data up to a certain timestamp\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For example, Kaggle had a competition to [predict the sales in a chain of Ecuadorian grocery stores](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting).

That way, the competition organizer ensured that entrants were making predictions for a time period that was *in the future*, from the perspective of their model. This is similar to the way quant hedge fund traders do *back-testing* to check whether their models are predictive of future periods, based on past data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A second common case is when you can easily anticipate ways the data you will be making predictions for in production may be *qualitatively different* from the data you have to train your model with.\n\nIn the Kaggle [distracted driver competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection), the independent variables are pictures of drivers at the wheel of a car, and the dependent variables are categories such as texting, eating, or safely looking ahead. Lots of pictures are of the same drivers in different positions, as we can see in <<img_driver>>. If you were an insurance company building a model from this data, note that you would be most interested in how the model performs on drivers it hasn't seen before (since you would likely have training data only for a small group of people). In recognition of this, the test data for the competition consists of images of people that don't appear in the training set.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"images/driver.PNG\" width=\"600\" id=\"img_driver\" caption=\"Two pictures from the training data\" alt=\"Two pictures from the training data, showing the same driver\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you put one of the images in <<img_driver>> in your training set and one in the validation set, your model will have an easy time making a prediction for the one in the validation set, so it will seem to be performing better than it would on new people. Another perspective is that if you used all the people in training your model, your model might be overfitting to particularities of those specific people, and not just learning the states (texting, eating, etc.).\n\nA similar dynamic was at work in the [Kaggle fisheries competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring) to identify the species of fish caught by fishing boats in order to reduce illegal fishing of endangered populations.  The test set consisted of boats that didn't appear in the training data.  This means that you'd want your validation set to include boats that are not in the training set.\n\nSometimes it may not be clear how your validation data will differ.
